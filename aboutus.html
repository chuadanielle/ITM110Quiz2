      Digital Espresso coffee shop and cafe delivers way beyond <br>
      the traditional coffee shop favorites. Our cafe offers <br>
      traditional but the best quality handcrafted coffee and <br>
      espresso drinks in Manila. The Digital Espresso first <br>
      started in Ateneo when 5 students decided to put up a JSEC <br>
      stall in 2003. After that, the demand for the coffee became <br>
      consistent as students loved the taste, quality and it's affordability.<br>
      Because of this, the owners decided to start their business outside <br>
      Ateneo and they put up their first branch in Regis, Katipunan. Since <br>
      then, the business grew and more and more customers come back for <br>
      their affordable and great quality coffee drinks.<br>
